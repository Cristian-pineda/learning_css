# learning_css

Hello, 

Within this repository you'll find the first couple of projects that I have ever worked on using css. 

I've put them together by following the steps in the Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp. Taught by Jose Portilla Head of Data Science, Pierian Data Inc. On Udemy

Please keep in mind that this is learning material, although I place a huge emphasys on user experience / vusual design withing my own work, these completed projects we're explicitly designed for learning, hence they are not the most visually applealing projects.  -Cristian
